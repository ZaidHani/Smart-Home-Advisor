+ Chatbot: Groq API with "llama-3.1-8b-instant" and "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" for embedding and FIASS as a vector database

### Data Pipeline Workflow
We have 2 data pipelines for this project, the first one is the initial data pipeline which will only run once and will pull all the properties data from OpenSooq, clean the data, and then store them in the data warehouse, and the second one is the incremental data pipeline which will run daily and pull only 1000 listing every day, clean them then store them, These pipelines are mostly similar, but there is a normalization method in the incremental pipeline to avoid primary key errors.

### Machine Learning Model
PyCaret is an automated machine-learning framework that constructs numerous data pipelines and identifies the model with the highestÂ efficiency.

### FastAPI
The web app is composed of 4 pages:
+ Home Page: Overview of the project
+ Models Page: Predict property prices
+ Dashboard Page: Visualize insights and trends
+ Chatbot Page: Interact with a RAG chatbot


### Conclusion
Smart Home Advisor is a data science project that handles the properties market and provides a web app to help users buy properties and discover the housing market trends.
